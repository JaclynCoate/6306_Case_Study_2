# DDS 6301: Frito Lay: Case Study 2

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to share my work in order to complete our MSDS DDS 6301 Final Case Study project. I analysied the given data sets on attrition, salary, and job role trends. The focus of this projet was to use the given data in order to advise our client (Frito Lay) on how to predit and combat attrition within their company. With these models I've created they will be able to predict attrition and attrition like trends in specific job roles. As well as use my salary analysis to help compete in the industry for competitive salaries and therefore lower the possibility of attrition.
